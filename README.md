# CAvSAT

CAvSAT (Consistent Answering via Satisfiability) project aims to be a scalable and comprehensive Consistent Query Answering (CQA) system. It encodes the CQA problem into variants of SAT, and uses modern SAT solvers to compute consistent answers to the input query.

Current version is a preliminary implementation of the SAT sovler module of CAvSAT, and it is still under development. Please contact Akhil Dixit (akadixit at ucsc dot edu) for more details about CAvSAT.
